# HTML Learning & Implementation

Welcome to my HTML learning repository!  
This project contains my hands-on exercises, notes, and implementations from the Codecademy HTML course. Each file demonstrates a different aspect of HTML, from basic document structure to forms, tables, and semantic markup.

## üìÅ Project Files

- [**Document Standard.html**](./Document%20Standard.html)  
  *A complete HTML document demonstrating standard structure, navigation, and content organization.*

- [**Elements & Structure.html**](./Elements%20&%20Structure.html)  
  *Explores HTML elements, nesting, and the use of structural tags.*

- [**Fashion Blog.html**](./Fashion%20Blog.html)  
  *A sample blog layout showcasing images, headings, links, and lists.*

- [**Form Validation.html**](./Form%20Validation.html)  
  *Demonstrates HTML form validation using attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `pattern`.*
